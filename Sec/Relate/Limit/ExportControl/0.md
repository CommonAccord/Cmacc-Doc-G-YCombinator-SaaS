Ti=Export Control

sec= {_P1} may not remove or export from the United States or allow the export or re-export of the {_Services}, {_Supplier_Software} or anything related thereto, or any direct product thereof in violation of any restrictions, laws or regulations of the United States Department of Commerce, the United States Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other United States or foreign agency or authority.  As defined in FAR section 2.101, the {_Supplier_Software} and documentation are "commercial items" and according to DFAR section 252.227 7014(a)(1) and (5) are deemed to be "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation."  Consistent with DFAR section 227.7202 and FAR section 12.212, any use modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such commercial software or commercial software documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by the terms of {_this_Agreement} and will be prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by the terms of {_this_Agreement}.

Note=export and government rights clauses are typically less important for pure hosted solutions, but there are still some potential triggers with certain kinds of technical information (and if there is any client-side code).
