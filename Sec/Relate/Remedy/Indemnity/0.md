Ti=Indemnity

Note=OPTIONAL: many start-up companies choose not to offer indemnity as a starting point - particularly for very low cost services. Otherwise, the formulation below is a fairly {_P2}-favorable indemnity provision.

1.sec={_P2} shall hold {_P1} harmless from liability to third parties resulting from infringement by the {_Service} of any United States patent or any copyright or misappropriation of any trade secret, provided {_P2} is promptly notified of any and all threats, claims and proceedings related thereto and given reasonable assistance and the opportunity to assume sole control over defense and settlement; {_P2} will not be responsible for any settlement it does not approve in writing.

2.0.sec=The foregoing obligations do not apply with respect to portions or components of the {_Service}: 

2.1.sec=not supplied by {_P2},

2.2.sec=made in whole or in part in accordance with {_P1} specifications,

2.3.sec=that are modified after delivery by {_P2},

2.4.sec=combined with other products, processes or materials where the alleged infringement relates to such combination,

2.5.sec=where {_P1} continues allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof or after being informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement, or

2.6.sec=where {_P1}'s use of the {_Service} is not strictly in accordance with {_this_Agreement}.  

2.=[G/Z/ol-i/s6]

3.0.sec=If, due to a claim of infringement, the {_Services} are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be or are believed by {_P2} to be infringing, {_P2} may, at its option and expense

3.1.sec=replace or modify the {_Service} to be non-infringing provided that such modification or replacement contains substantially similar features and functionality,

3.2.sec=obtain for {_P1} a license to continue using the Service, or

3.3.sec=if neither of the foregoing is commercially practicable, terminate {_this_Agreement} and {_P1}'s rights hereunder and provide {_P1} a refund of any prepaid, unused fees for the Service.
